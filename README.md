# react-color-generator

Generate a range of colors (values: lighter colors - tints, and darker colors - shades) that are variations of a passed in hex value (serving as the base color). Additionally features functionality for copying to clipboard when a color is clicked - after it's copied, a textual alert is shown for three seconds. Visual feedback (a red input border) is provided in the case of an invalid hex code. A lighter font color is applied to text displayed on shades.

Color values are retrieved using the library [values.js](https://github.com/noeldelgado/values.js).

To view, run `npm i && npm start` in downloaded project.
